*Q1*: I'm getting set of following error messages above the channels list:
   Warning: session_start(): open(/tmp/sess_67097718925a02165591a622f2641d91, 
   O_RDWR) failed: Permission denied (13) in 
   /opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/HARD_DISK/kartina.tv/index.php on line 15
*A1*: Please make sure at least one of following services is running:
    * Torrent
    * Usenet Client
    * Casgle Client

*Q2*: Can't watch any channel. I see the channels list but when I'm trying to start the playback I see the PCH logo for several seconds and then I'm returned back to programs list.

*A2*: Please make sure you are *NOT* using one of following firmwares: 
    * PCH-A100: from 21 January 2009, 03 March 2009 or 02 April 2009
    * PCH-A110: from 26 February 2009 or 02 April 2009
These firmware officially doesn't support KartinaTV. All others (before and after) are compatible with KartinaTV.

*Q3*: If I press ZOOM during playback then instead of zooming the playback hangs and only reboot can help. 

*A3*: Try to change in PCH video options the colorspace. In my case the 16-235 was the right value.

*Q4*: You see an error message after changing the settings. 

*A3*: Make sure the permissions of settings.inc file are set to 0666 or 0777 (writing allowed to everyone).
